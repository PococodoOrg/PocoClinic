# ADR 001: Use Vite for Frontend Build Tool and Development Environment

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to choose a build tool and development environment for our React TypeScript frontend application. The main options considered were:

1. Create React App (CRA)
2. Vite
3. Next.js
4. Custom Webpack configuration

Key considerations included:
- Development server performance
- Build time efficiency
- Testing setup and integration
- TypeScript support
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) capabilities
- Community support and ecosystem
- Configuration flexibility

## Decision

We have chosen to use Vite as our frontend build tool and development environment.

## Consequences

### Advantages

1. **Development Performance**
   - Significantly faster development server startup compared to CRA
   - Instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) using native ES modules
   - No bundling required in development, resulting in faster feedback loops

2. **Build Performance**
   - Optimized production builds using Rollup
   - Better code splitting and lazy loading support
   - Smaller bundle sizes through better tree-shaking

3. **Testing Integration**
   - Native integration with Vitest, which provides:
     - Jest-compatible API
     - Out-of-the-box TypeScript support
     - Faster test execution through Vite's native ESM support
     - Shared configuration with Vite
     - Support for React Testing Library

4. **Modern Development**
   - First-class TypeScript support
   - Built-in support for CSS modules, PostCSS, and other modern tools
   - Native ESM-based development environment
   - Simple and intuitive configuration

### Disadvantages

1. **Ecosystem Maturity**
   - Newer than Create React App, meaning some plugins/tools might not be as mature
   - Some legacy packages might require additional configuration
   - Community resources might be less abundant compared to CRA

2. **Testing Differences**
   - While Vitest is Jest-compatible, there might be some edge cases where Jest behavior differs
   - Some Jest-specific plugins might need alternatives or adaptations
   - Team members familiar with Jest might need some adjustment time

3. **Migration Challenges**
   - Moving existing CRA projects to Vite requires manual configuration
   - Some build configurations might need to be recreated
   - Legacy code might need adjustments to work with ESM imports

## Alternatives Considered

### Create React App (CRA)
- Pros: Most mature solution, extensive documentation, large community
- Cons: Slower development server, longer build times, limited configuration options

### Next.js
- Pros: Full-featured framework, SSR support, excellent production optimization
- Cons: Overkill for our SPA needs, more complex setup, steeper learning curve

### Custom Webpack
- Pros: Maximum flexibility, complete control over configuration
- Cons: High maintenance burden, requires significant expertise, time-consuming setup

## Implementation Notes

Our implementation includes:
- Vite for development and build
- Vitest for testing with React Testing Library
- ESLint and TypeScript for static analysis
- Mantine UI components with HMR support
- Proxy configuration for API requests
