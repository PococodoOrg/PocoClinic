# ADR 008: Testing Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to establish a comprehensive testing strategy that would:
- Ensure code quality and reliability
- Support both frontend and backend testing
- Provide fast feedback during development
- Enable easy CI/CD integration
- Support TypeScript and Go
- Balance coverage and maintenance effort

## Decision

We have chosen a multi-layered testing approach:

1. **Frontend Testing**
   - Vitest as the test runner
   - React Testing Library for component testing
   - Jest-compatible API
   - MSW for API mocking

2. **Backend Testing**
   - Go's built-in testing framework
   - Table-driven tests
   - Integration tests with testcontainers
   - API tests with httptest

## Consequences

### Advantages

1. **Developer Experience**
   - Fast test execution with Vitest
   - Familiar testing APIs (Jest-compatible)
   - Easy setup and configuration
   - Good IDE integration
   - Watch mode for development

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Unit testing for both frontend and backend
   - Integration testing capabilities
   - Component testing with user-centric approach
   - API contract testing
   - Easy mocking and stubbing

3. **Maintenance**
   - Consistent testing patterns
   - Shared test utilities
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable test fixtures
   - Automated test generation tools support

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Parallel test execution
   - Coverage reporting
   - Test timing metrics
   - Failure analysis
   - Screenshot diffing capability

### Disadvantages

1. **Setup Complexity**
   - Multiple testing tools to maintain
   - Configuration overhead
   - Environment-specific setup needed
   - Mock data management

2. **Learning Curve**
   - Team needs to learn multiple testing approaches
   - Understanding best practices for each layer
   - Mastering testing patterns

3. **Resource Usage**
   - CI pipeline time for comprehensive testing
   - Local machine resources for test runs
   - Storage for test artifacts

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Testing (Vitest + React Testing Library)
```typescript
// Component Test Example
describe('Component', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<Component />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Backend Testing (Go)
```go
// Table-Driven Test Example
func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected int
    }{
        {"valid input", "test", 200},
        {"invalid input", "", 400},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Organization**
   - Co-locate tests with source files
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Keep tests focused and atomic

2. **Coverage Goals**
   - 80% code coverage target
   - Critical paths must have tests
   - Edge cases should be covered
   - UI components should have interaction tests

3. **Performance**
   - Tests should run quickly
   - Avoid unnecessary setup/teardown
   - Use test parallelization where possible
   - Mock expensive operations

4. **Maintenance**
   - Regular test review and cleanup
   - Update tests with code changes
   - Remove flaky tests
   - Document testing patterns
