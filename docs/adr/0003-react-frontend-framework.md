# ADR-0003: React as Frontend Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The PocoClinic EMR system requires a robust, maintainable, and performant frontend solution that can handle complex healthcare workflows, real-time updates, and a large number of interactive components. Key considerations include:

- Healthcare UIs require complex state management for patient data
- Team needs strong tooling and debugging capabilities
- System must be highly maintainable and testable
- Components should be reusable across different parts of the application
- Performance is critical for healthcare workflows
- Large ecosystem of libraries for common healthcare UI patterns
- Must support accessibility standards for healthcare applications

## Decision
We will use React as our frontend framework, specifically leveraging:

- React 18+ for concurrent rendering features
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Query for server state management
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing

## Consequences

### Positive
- Mature ecosystem with proven track record in healthcare applications
- Strong TypeScript support for better maintainability
- Large talent pool for future team expansion
- Excellent developer tools (React DevTools, TypeScript)
- Rich component ecosystem reduces development time
- Server Components and Suspense for better performance
- Well-documented patterns for complex state management
- Strong testing ecosystem

### Negative
- Learning curve for developers new to React
- Bundle size needs careful management
- Need to carefully manage re-renders for performance
- Must establish clear patterns for state management
- Requires additional setup for SSR if needed

### Mitigations
- Use Next.js for built-in performance optimizations
- Implement strict linting rules for consistent patterns
- Create shared component library for consistency
- Regular performance audits using React DevTools
- Comprehensive documentation of component patterns
