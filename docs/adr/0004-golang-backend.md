# ADR-0004: Go as Backend Language

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The PocoClinic EMR system requires a backend technology that can handle healthcare workloads with:

- High reliability and stability
- Strong type safety and compile-time checks
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Simple deployment and operations
- Clear patterns for concurrent operations
- Strong security practices
- Easy learning curve for team maintenance

We need a language that enforces consistency and maintainability while providing modern features for building healthcare APIs.

## Decision
We will use Go (Golang) as our backend language, specifically:

- Go 1.21+ for generics and performance improvements
- Standard library for HTTP server and core functionality
- Minimal external dependencies for better security
- Built-in testing framework
- Go modules for dependency management
- Go routines and channels for concurrent operations

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simple, readable syntax reduces maintenance burden
- Strong standard library reduces external dependencies
- Built-in concurrency with goroutines and channels
- Fast compilation and startup times
- Static typing catches errors early
- Single binary deployments simplify operations
- Built-in testing and profiling tools
- Strong security practices in standard library
- Growing ecosystem in healthcare domain
- Excellent performance characteristics

### Negative
- Less flexible than dynamic languages
- More verbose than some alternatives
- Fewer healthcare-specific libraries compared to Java/Python
- Team needs to learn Go idioms and patterns
- Error handling requires explicit checks
- No built-in generics for older Go versions

### Mitigations
- Create shared utility packages for common operations
- Establish clear error handling patterns
- Document Go idioms used in codebase
- Regular code reviews to maintain consistency
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Use linters to enforce style and catch issues
