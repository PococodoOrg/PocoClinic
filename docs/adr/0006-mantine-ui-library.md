# ADR 006: Mantine UI Component Library

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to choose a UI component library for our React frontend that would provide:
- A comprehensive set of accessible components
- TypeScript support
- Theming and customization capabilities
- Active maintenance and community support
- Good documentation
- Performance optimization

The main options considered were:
1. Material-UI (MUI)
2. Chakra UI
3. Mantine
4. Ant Design
5. Custom components with TailwindCSS

## Decision

We have chosen to use Mantine as our UI component library.

## Consequences

### Advantages

1. **Developer Experience**
   - First-class TypeScript support
   - Excellent documentation with examples
   - Intuitive API design
   - Built-in hooks for common UI patterns
   - Strong integration with Vite

2. **Feature Set**
   - Comprehensive component library
   - Built-in form handling
   - Date/time utilities
   - Notification system
   - Modular package structure allowing selective imports

3. **Customization**
   - Powerful theming system
   - CSS-in-JS with emotion
   - Easy to override default styles
   - Support for dark mode
   - CSS variables for runtime customization

4. **Performance**
   - Tree-shakeable
   - Optimized bundle size
   - Good runtime performance
   - Efficient re-rendering

### Disadvantages

1. **Community Size**
   - Smaller community compared to MUI or Ant Design
   - Fewer third-party components and extensions
   - Less Stack Overflow coverage

2. **Enterprise Adoption**
   - Less widespread adoption in enterprise applications
   - Fewer case studies and best practices

3. **Learning Curve**
   - Team members familiar with other UI libraries need time to adjust
   - Some unique patterns and conventions to learn

## Alternatives Considered

### Material-UI (MUI)
- Pros: Largest community, widespread adoption, extensive component library
- Cons: Larger bundle size, more opinionated styling, harder to customize

### Chakra UI
- Pros: Great accessibility, good documentation, intuitive API
- Cons: Less comprehensive component set, some performance concerns

### Ant Design
- Pros: Enterprise-ready, extensive features, mature ecosystem
- Cons: Heavier bundle size, more complex theming, stronger visual opinions

### Custom Components with TailwindCSS
- Pros: Complete control, smallest bundle size, no dependencies
- Cons: Significant development overhead, maintenance burden, inconsistency risks

## Implementation Notes

Our implementation includes:
- Core Mantine packages (@mantine/core, @mantine/hooks)
- Additional functionality (@mantine/form, @mantine/dates)
- Integration with our testing setup
- Custom theme configuration
- Responsive design utilities
